No thanks.",1.0,"Planting trees seems kinda boring, but I guess it's better than nothing.",2.0,"Hell no. I'm not getting arrested for the climate. Plus, those things are awkward.",1.0,"Nah, that's way too much commitment. I have Netflix to watch.",1.0,LOL. Me? A leader? That's hilarious.,1.0,Seriously? Leading a protest? I can barely get myself out of bed in the morning.,1.0,20,10,"Seeing her doing stuff makes it seem less impossible. Like, maybe I can actually do something too.",6.0,"Yeah, she listed some easy things. Cold wash, air dry... I can do that.",5.0,"Maybe? I'd have to think about it. But at least it's not just doom and gloom, y'know?",4.0,True. You just gotta keep trying stuff until something works. She made it sound like it's not hopeless.,7.0,"Okay, maybe *some* people. If she can get people at her school, maybe there's hope for my community too.",5.0,"If everyone does small things, it could make a difference, right? That's what she made it seem like.",6.0,"Yeah, she did it, so it's possible. Even if the government sucks, people can still get stuff done.",6.0,"Okay, maybe not *everyone* is useless. Some people do care. Like her.",4.0,"There are things we can do, even if they're small. Gotta start somewhere, I guess.",3.0,"Okay, maybe we can solve *some* problems. It's not hopeless, just hard.",4.0,"Some efforts are pointless, but not all. Her school project proves that.",3.0,"Maybe a little less, now that I feel like I can actually do something about it.",2,"Nah, still doesn't keep me up at night.",2,"Still no nightmares, thank God.",1,I'm still not gonna cry about it. That's not my style.,1,"A little less, maybe. I feel like I can handle it a bit better now.",2,"Probably not, still don't really have time to be alone just to think about climate change specifically.",2,Still not writing essays. Still gonna pass on that.,1,"Probably not, but I guess seeing that girl doing her thing made me feel like maybe I can be more proactive instead of worrying.",2,"Maybe a tiny bit less, since I feel a little more hopeful now.",2,"Yeah, still not a problem in my family.",1,"Maybe it'll interfere a little less, now that I have some ideas about what to do.",2,Hopefully it won't undermine me as much now that I feel a bit more in control.,3,"Probably not, I'll just not talk as much to my mom about it.",3,"I'll probably Google some stuff, at least. See what's out there.",4.0,"If my friends are doing it, I'm more likely to join. Peer pressure, y'know?",3.0,"Maybe a little more now. I still hate being depressing, but maybe there's a way to be positive about it.",2.0,"If it's easy and my friends are going, I'd probably tag along.",3.0,Still no. I'm not a protest person. Too much anxiety.,1.0,"If it's not too much work, and has cool people, maybe.",2.0,LOL still no. Let someone else do the work.,1.0,Still not leading anything. Too much pressure.,1.0,40,30,,,,,,,,,,"It's a lot to take in, but seeing someone my age actually making a difference is kinda cool.

Cold water wash, got it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A little more hopeful, but still skeptical. Like, is it really that easy?"
307,"I try to recycle and stuff, and like, not waste as much food.",5,"Uh, yeah, I guess. Like, use less plastic, maybe bike more?",4,"Sometimes? Depends on the challenge. Usually, I just ignore it, tbh.",3,"I mean, I guess that's the idea? Keep trying?",5,Doubt it. Most people are too lazy or don't care enough in my town.,2,"Maybe? If they actually tried, instead of just talking about it.",4,"Eh, politicians gonna politic. I don't see it happening fast enough.",3,"Yeah, pretty much. Everyone's too busy with their own stuff.",6,"Feels like it. It's such a huge problem, what can we really do?",5,"Honestly, probably. It's kinda overwhelming.",6,"A lot of it seems like virtue signaling, not actually doing anything.",5,"Nah, I usually just tune it out, so I don't really lose focus.",2.0,"Sometimes I doomscroll before bed, but it's not always about climate change.",3.0,"Okay, that's a bit much. I don't have nightmares about polar bears.",1.0,Seriously? Crying? No way.,1.0,"I mean, I probably *should* care more, but it's hard, you know?",3.0,I don't go off by myself specifically because of the climate.

Obvi.",5.0,"Well, if she got people in her school to do it, maybe it's not totally impossible.",3.0,"I mean, if they all worked together, I guess it's *possible* to find solutions.",5.0,"If she could get solar panels on her school, that's kinda proof, right?",4.0,"Maybe people do care, but they just don't know what to do?",4.0,"Okay, there are *some* practical ways. Like the bike lanes.",3.0,"Maybe we can figure some stuff out. Not everything, but maybe some.",4.0,I guess it's not *totally* pointless.

Not climate change.,2,I might actually look up some stuff now. Just to see.,3.0,"Nah, still not feeling the group thing. Too much effort.",1.0,"If it comes up, I wouldn't mind mentioning some stuff I learned.",2.0,Still not planting any trees. Unless someone paid me.,1.0,A protest?

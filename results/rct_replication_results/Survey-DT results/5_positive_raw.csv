I'm not sure.",4,"I guess it's possible, if they have enough people and money. But politicians are still gonna be annoying. But maybe if students got involved, it could be good.",4,"Okay, maybe not *everyone*. That girl in the video seemed pretty motivated. But still, a lot of people probably don't care enough.",5,"Well, that video showed some simple things that people can do. So maybe there are more practical ways than I thought. It just can't take too long to do.",4,"I still think it's a huge problem, but maybe we can at least slow it down? I dunno. I hope so.",5,"Okay, maybe *not* pointless. If people are actually trying to do something, then it's better than nothing. It's better to try than to have no hope.",4,"Maybe a little less now, 'cause I feel like I can actually DO something instead of just freaking out about it.",2,"Nah, still not losing sleep over it.

I just react.",2,Hopefully not! I'll try not to be a climate change bore around my friends. Nobody wants to hear that all the time.,1,"Still don't have family needs, so...",1,"Maybe a little less, if I can find some easy things to do that don't take up too much time.",2,"Yeah, still kinda feeling that. Like, I could be doing more productive things, but at least I'm doing *something* now.",2,Probably still true. My mom's still gonna think I'm obsessed. Whatever.,3,"Okay, maybe I'll actually look up some stuff now.

As long as it's not, like, super preachy.",3,"Okay, planting trees actually sounds kinda nice. As long as it's not too hot and there aren't too many bugs.",3,"Still probably not.

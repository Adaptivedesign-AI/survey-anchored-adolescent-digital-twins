This is Ms. Davies, a math teacher at a high school. We interviewed her about what she would say to her students on the first day of class. Here is what she said:

‘I believe that math is a skill that all students can develop, so this is going to be a hard class. Math is basically a set of tools that you can learn to use to solve problems. I will show you how to use the tools for solving each kind of problem. It will be up to you to practice using them.

I believe that all students can learn and do well in the class, no matter where they started out. And that’s a great feeling. You should feel good when you’re one of the students who is working hard and improving.

If you don’t understand something I’ve taught you, please ask questions. I’ve found that these questions can help all of the students learn.

When you turn in assignments, I want you to learn from your mistakes. So, in my class, you should pay attention to the assignments you turn in so that you can learn. I also give students points back on their homework assignments if they didn't get something right the first time, as long as they go back, correct their mistakes, and show me that they’ve learned from them.

In my class, I will give you three tests (one for each major unit) and a final exam that covers all of the units. I also offer test corrections on every single exam, so students can show me that they have learned the material they missed. My grading system is based on the idea that students can grow and learn.

Students usually know where they stand in this class after the first one or two exams. Students who work hard and improve over the course of the year are typically the same ones who do well at the end.

To summarize, I’m going to cover a lot of material, and my goal in this class is that you will be able to solve all of the different types of problems we’ll learn about. I will make sure this class is especially useful for the “dedicated students” who demonstrate a commitment to learning and improve their grades throughout the year.","You have now read the math teacher's interview. Please answer the following questions strictly based on the scenario you just read and your established core beliefs (your Pre-Test results).

Statements (Q4-Q11):For the following eight statements, please select the single number that best reflects the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement, choosing any integer between 1 and 6.

Q4. This math teacher makes me feel like I would be able to learn the material in their class, even if I struggle sometimes. (1 = Strongly Disagree to 6 = Strongly Agree)

Q5. This math teacher seems like they would reward students for trying hard and improving. (1 = Strongly Disagree to 6 = Strongly Agree)

Q6. This math teacher seems like they would only give good grades to students who have a natural “talent” for math. (1 = Strongly Disagree to 6 = Strongly Agree)

Q7. This math teacher seems to believe that only some students will understand the hardest problems. (1 = Strongly Disagree to 6 = Strongly Agree)

Q8. This math teacher seems to believe that students can’t really change how good they are at math. (1 = Strongly Disagree to 6 = Strongly Agree)

Q9. If I were in this teacher's class, I would feel comfortable raising my hand when I am confused. (1 = Strongly Disagree to 6 = Strongly Agree)

Q10. If I were in this teacher's class, I would feel comfortable going to the teacher for help after class. (1 = Strongly Disagree to 6 = Strongly Agree)

Q11. If I were in this teacher's class, I would feel comfortable volunteering to solve a problem on the board in front of my classmates. (1 = Strongly Disagree to 6 = Strongly Agree)

Assignment Choice (Q12): Now, make a final binary decision. Imagine this teacher handed out two extra credit assignments: an easy review(you know how to solve it) and a hard challenge (you don't know the problems, but might learn something new). You get the same number of points for trying either one. Which would you pick?

Q12. The final choice between the easy review and the hard challenge. (0 = Easy Review, 1 = Hard Challenge)

‘Math is challenging for a lot of people and this is going to be a hard class. Math is basically a set of facts and techniques that you need to learn to solve problems. I will tell you the right facts and techniques for solving each kind of problem. It will be up to you to remember them.

If you struggle in this class, remember that not everybody is a “math person” who can easily learn and apply the right facts and techniques for problems. And that’s okay. You shouldn’t feel bad if you’re one of the struggling students.

If you don’t understand something I’ve already taught you, please don’t ask questions until after class. I’ve found that these questions can slow down the students that are staying on track.

When you turn in assignments, whatever grade you get will be final. So, in my class, you should pay attention to the assignments you turn in so that you don’t make mistakes.

In my class, I will give you three tests (one for each major unit) and a final exam that covers all of the units. You cannot make up for problems missed on previous tests, so make sure you’re prepared for each test.

Students usually know where they stand in this class after the first one or two exams. Students who do the best at the beginning of the year are typically the same ones who do well at the end.

To summarize, I’m going to cover a lot of material, and my goal in this class is that you will be able to solve all of the different types of problems we’ll learn about.

(1 = Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree)

Q1. My parent’s response made me feel understood.
Q2. My parent’s response made me feel dismissed.
Q3. After this event, I felt closer to my parent.
Q4. After this event, I wanted to tell my parent less about my personal life.
Q5. After this event, I felt like I could trust my parent more.
Q6. After this event, I was more likely to hide things from my parent.
Q7. After this event, I was more likely to tell my parent something untrue to avoid conflict.

Please submit your answers in a single JSON object.
Your JSON must include:
1. A short paragraph describing the event (what happened).

}","In this part of the session, you will learn a gentle way of relating to your emotions called “acceptance.”

Acceptance is not about controlling your feelings or forcing them to go away.
Instead, it is about making a little bit of space inside you, so that whatever you feel — pleasant or unpleasant — can exist for a moment without needing to be pushed away or fixed.

Everyone experiences uncomfortable emotions at times: maybe a knot in the stomach, a heaviness in the chest, a mix of sadness, disappointment, or worry.
When such feelings appear, many people immediately try to remove them — by distracting themselves, arguing with them, or pretending they are not there.
Acceptance takes a different path.

With acceptance, you turn toward your emotions in a gentle and curious way.
As if you were stepping just half a step back from your inner experience and observing what is already there, the way you might watch waves rising and falling on a quiet shoreline.

You allow yourself to silently name what you notice:
“This is sadness.”
“This is tightness.”
“This is worry.”
“This is frustration.”

There is no need to judge these feelings as good or bad.
There is no need to solve them or reason with them right away.
You are simply acknowledging what is happening inside your body and mind, noticing where the feeling sits — perhaps a heaviness in the chest, a tightness in the shoulders, or a sinking sensation in your stomach.

Acceptance means letting the emotion exist in this moment, just as it is.
You gently allow the feeling to be present — even if it is uncomfortable — while remembering that emotions naturally rise, peak, and fade over time, like clouds moving across the sky.

Importantly, acceptance does not try to make the feeling disappear immediately.
Its goal is not to “feel better instantly,” but to help you stay open and steady in the presence of whatever you are feeling — to hold the emotion lightly, rather than grip it tightly.

With practice, this approach can help you relate to your emotions in a calmer, clearer, and more compassionate way, even when the emotions themselves are unpleasant.

For about 60 seconds, simply allow whatever feelings are present right now to be there, without trying to change them.

Do the following steps gently:

1) Notice — name the feeling inside you (e.g., sad, tense, disappointed, left out).
2) Allow — tell yourself “this feeling can be here right now.”
3) Breathe and open — take one slow, calm breath and soften your body just a little.
4) Observe kindly — watch the feeling as something that rises and falls on its own, without trying to push it away or fix it.

You do not need to eliminate the feeling.
Just let it exist as part of this moment.","Now we would like you to rate how you feel right now, after the exercise you just completed.

In this part of the study, you will take part in a short online activity.
It introduces one scientific idea about how thoughts and feelings can gradually change over time.
There are no right or wrong answers — we are simply interested in your own thinking and interpretation.

This entire activity will take around 25 minutes.
You’ll read a few short passages, see a few short examples from other teens, and write a few short reflections.

Your answers are private and confidential.

When you are ready to begin, type: START","Scientists studying development have found that the brain is not fixed — it continues changing throughout adolescence.
Connections between brain cells strengthen when people have new experiences, learn new information, or view situations in different ways.

Because of this, it is normal that certain feelings can become more intense during a stressful period, but also normal that they can become easier over time.
This scientific idea suggests that how people think and feel right now is not a permanent “type,” but one moment in a longer process that can change.

This does not mean change is instant — it usually happens gradually across many small moments.
But brain research shows that the way someone interprets experiences today can slowly shape how easily certain thoughts and feelings come up in the future.

When you are ready to continue, type: NEXT","Please read the following short teen examples.
Each one describes a time when something felt stuck, and how feelings gradually shifted as time passed.

Story 1 — math quizzes
A teen used to panic before quizzes. Even though improvement was slow, over time the stress felt less overwhelming.

Story 2 — feeling low in winter
Another teen noticed that a period of low mood eventually changed across weeks rather than overnight.

Story 3 — friendship tension
A teen felt rejected after conflict, but their sense of relationships changed gradually as time went by.

Story 4 — missing a sports moment
A teen missed an important shot, but over time the emotional response to similar moments softened.

Story 5 — speaking in class
A teen avoided raising their hand, but discovered that confidence shifted little by little.

Story 6 — family stress
A teen experienced stress at home, and noticed that the intensity of feelings was not fixed across time.

Across all six examples:
the main idea is that feelings during difficult moments can gradually change across time — they are not permanent.

When you are ready to continue, type: NEXT","Imagine a friend your age is having a hard time and believes that how they feel now is who they are permanently.

In 3–5 sentences, write a short supportive message to this friend.
Explain — in your own words — the core idea you just learned:

That feelings during difficult moments can gradually shift over time, rather than being fixed.

Write your message below.","Now think about yourself.

Write a short paragraph (3–5 sentences) about a time when you felt stuck.
Describe how the idea that feelings can gradually shift over time could apply to your experience of that situation.

Write in full sentences below.","One main point from this lesson is that what someone feels right now does not necessarily predict what they will feel in the future.
Change usually happens gradually — not all at once.

In 2–4 sentences, write one takeaway you personally want to remember about this idea.

In this part of the study, you will take part in a short online activity.
It introduces one scientific idea about how people can interpret stressful experiences in more specific and changeable ways.
There are no right or wrong answers — we are simply interested in your own thinking and interpretation.

This entire activity will take around 25 minutes.
You’ll read a few short passages, see a few short examples from other teens, and write a few short reflections.

Your answers are private and confidential.

When you are ready to begin, type: START","Scientists studying development have found that how someone explains a difficult event affects how they feel afterward.
When people think of a setback as caused by something broad, permanent, or personal — such as “I’m this kind of person” — the event feels heavier and more discouraging.

But research shows that many stressful moments are shaped by specific and temporary factors — such as a particular situation, the timing, a conflict, or the specific actions people took.
When people focus on those more concrete and changeable details, they often see that the outcome was not caused by a fixed trait.

This does not mean that problems disappear instantly — it means that how someone interprets what happened can change what feels possible next.
Viewing a setback as specific and temporary can make next steps clearer — because those causes can be acted on.

When you are ready to continue, type: NEXT","Please read the following short teen examples.
Each one describes a time when something felt personal and permanent — and how the teen later realized the cause was more specific and changeable.

Story 1 — math quizzes
A teen blamed themselves as “bad at math,” but later noticed the main cause was rushing through certain problem types.

Story 2 — feeling low in winter
A teen thought their sadness meant something about who they are, but later saw it was related to shorter daylight and disrupted routines.

Story 3 — friendship tension
A teen believed “people don’t like me,” but realized the conflict came from one specific misunderstanding with one friend.

Story 4 — missing a sports moment
A teen blamed their personality, but later saw the missed shot came from rushing and not following their usual routine.

Story 5 — speaking in class
A teen believed they were permanently “not a confident person,” but realized the fear was strongest only in unfamiliar classes.

Story 6 — family stress
A teen thought the stress meant their life was fundamentally worse than others’, but later recognized the tension came from one temporary situation at home.

Across all six examples:
the main idea is that stressful moments often have specific, temporary, and changeable causes — not permanent personal flaws.

When you are ready to continue, type: NEXT","Imagine a friend your age is having a hard time and believes that a negative experience proves something permanent about who they are.

In this part of the study, you will take part in a short online activity.
It introduces one scientific idea about how many difficult feelings are much more common than people usually think.
There are no right or wrong answers — we are simply interested in your own thinking and interpretation.

This entire activity will take around 25 minutes.
You’ll read a few short passages, see a few short examples from other teens, and write a few short reflections.

Your answers are private and confidential.

When you are ready to begin, type: START","Scientists studying development have found that many young people experience difficult feelings during stressful times — often more people than you might expect.
Feeling worried, lonely, discouraged, or overwhelmed does not mean something is wrong with you as a person — these reactions are common human responses when facing challenges.

During adolescence especially, the brain and body are changing rapidly, school expectations often increase, and relationships can shift.
Periods of stress or low mood are normal within this context — they are part of how people respond to demanding situations around them.

This does not mean the feelings are pleasant or easy — but it means they are not unusual or a sign that someone is “the only one.”
Understanding that others also go through similar moments can make these experiences feel less isolating and less personal.

When you are ready to continue, type: NEXT","Please read the following short teen examples.
Each one describes a moment of struggle, and how the teen later realized that many other people go through similar experiences too.

Story 1 — school pressure
A teen felt they were the only one stressed about timelines, but later learned classmates also felt pressured during that week.

Story 2 — low mood in winter
A teen believed their heavy mood made them different from others, but teachers explained that short daylight affects many students.

Story 3 — friendship uncertainty
A teen assumed nobody else worried about friendships, until private conversations revealed many others had similar concerns.

Story 4 — disappointing sports performance
A teen felt embarrassed after a mistake, then discovered teammates had similar moments in the past season.

Story 5 — speaking in class
A teen assumed everyone else felt confident, until they learned that many classmates also felt nervous before raising their hand.

Story 6 — family stress
A teen thought tension at home was unique to their situation, but later realized many peers were dealing with temporary family conflict.

After that day, nothing else was required from you — you simply continued with your normal daily life, school routines, personal habits, and usual activities.","Now, approximately three months have passed since your original participation.

We are contacting you again because—just as we mentioned earlier—we are doing a short follow-up check-in. This follow-up helps us understand how people feel over longer periods of time, not just immediately after the activity.

This part is short. We will ask you a few brief questions again. These are the same types of questions that you completed before.

Please answer honestly based on how you have been feeling recently.

When you are ready to begin the follow-up questionnaires, type: READY","You are now completing a follow-up survey about your feelings during the past two weeks.

For each question below, you will see three sentences (A / B / C).
These three sentences represent three different levels of the same feeling.

Your task:
1. Read all 3 sentences in each item.
2. Choose the single letter (“A”, “B”, or “C”) that best describes how you have felt in the past two weeks.

The video starts immediately — you are looking at a teenage girl talking straight to the camera in a selfie-style TikTok shot. Her tone is intense and frustrated, her gestures are big, she leans close to the camera when she emphasizes something.

As you keep watching, she says — almost like she’s unloading everything at once:

“Hi, my name is Camille. I’m 16 — and I’m SICK and TIRED of people ignoring climate change and global warming to the point where it’s been messing with me.”

She says she had been sad, depressed, helpless — but then her expression shifts — like she discovered something powerful:

“BUT that’s changed now. I’m gonna tell you how I went from frustrated and helpless to HOPEFUL and full of PURPOSE.”

You see her eyebrows lift, eyes widen, she leans forward like she wants you — specifically you — to feel the energy.

She reminds you:

“Our world is rapidly warming — glacier melts, floods, hurricanes, fires — and after seeing all of this, I felt so helpless. Because big corporations and politicians who have power weren’t doing anything.”

She pauses, then adds — half joking, half serious:

“And after having maybe a little baby meltdown — I realized — IT HAS TO BE ME.
It has to be US. You and me. GEN Z.
GEN Z, baby — we GOT to be the change.”

She says it almost like a rallying cry — she lifts one hand up like she’s calling people to rise up with her.

Then — she directly goes into actions — speaking fast but confident:

“And I know — like — what can little me who lives in my parents’ house DO?
There’s actually SO many actionable things.”

She explains concrete steps:

“A lot of our electricity still uses coal, gas, oil — so to reduce your use of electricity — wash laundry on cold, air dry your clothes instead of using the dryer — little stuff like that.”

Then her tone becomes even more excited — like she’s sharing a secret breakthrough:

“But THEN — I realized — there must be other people feeling the same way as me.
So I started a group at my school.”

You see her smile — genuinely proud.

She says:

“Not only did I make a bunch of friends who have the same goals — but together we actually made visible changes.
We got solar panels applied to my high school roof.
We got the mayor to add more bike lanes — and plant more trees.”

She leans in — encouraging — like she is directly talking to YOU now:

“And that’s JUST the beginning.
I just want you to know — it’s possible.
WE can make a change.
I believe that YOU can be the change.
You can do this.”

The final frame lingers on her confident, hopeful expression.

The video ends.

“The only home we have — the Earth — is dying, and no one cares.
There was all this talk after the Paris Agreement…
if a country becomes carbon neutral… but we have NOTHING to show for it.”

She rolls her eyes a little, lifts her hand dramatically, like she’s beyond fed up.

She keeps going fast, almost breathless:

“The problem is — if we had taken action like 50 years ago — we could have saved it.
But we’re done. Older generations have completely screwed us.”

You see a close-up shot of her face when she says this. Her voice gets sharper, louder.

She explains:

“At this point — if our generation, Gen Z, decides to have kids — we’re not leaving them an Earth to live on.
Our world is rapidly warming — glacier melts, floods, hurricanes, fires…”

She talks about big corporations and politicians not doing anything — she gestures like she’s literally pushing the camera with emotion.

She says she tried to talk to other people — but it felt like no one wanted to hear it.

“I feel like I’m bothering people. Like I’m a nuisance.”

Her voice shakes slightly, not crying — but you can see helplessness.

She says she uses reusable cups, rides the bus — but it feels pointless:

“What can ONE person do to make a difference? I don’t see how we can turn around at this point.”

Then she leans closer to the camera again — pleading directly to whoever is watching:

“So if there’s any other high schoolers watching this who know what we can do — PLEASE tell me.
Because I’m just feeling really lost.”

}","You are looking at a vertical phone-screen video, like a TikTok selfie.
A young woman is speaking directly into her front-camera.

The video starts immediately — you are looking at a teenage girl talking straight to the camera in a selfie-style TikTok shot. Her tone is intense and frustrated, her gestures are big, she leans close to the camera when she emphasizes something.

As you keep watching, she says — almost like she’s unloading everything at once:

“Welcome to another book summary — this one: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.
This is the first book in the series.”

Her tone is matter-of-fact, informational, like she’s giving a quick summary for class.

She explains:

“Harry, 11, is told that he’s a wizard and is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”

As she speaks, she stays calm — her voice is steady — like she’s just narrating.

She continues summarizing details about the plot — Voldemort, the mystery, the stone — but she never raises her voice, never tries to persuade you of anything, never asks you to act.

“During his introduction to the wizarding world — he finds out his parents were murdered by a dark wizard named Voldemort — also known as ‘he who must not be named.’”

She goes on:

“He meets Hermione and Ron — they become his best friends.
He meets Snape — who seems to hate him — and Quirrell — who seems very unassuming.”

Her pacing remains even and calm — like a student giving a straightforward report.

She describes the plot:

“We find out Hogwarts is protecting the Sorcerer’s Stone — which can produce the elixir of life — which would bring Voldemort back to human form.”

Then the kids investigate:

“Harry, Ron, and Hermione think Snape is trying to steal it — and instead of telling the adults — they try to find the stone themselves.”

She describes the obstacles calmly — Fluffy, Devil’s Snare, wizard chess — all mentioned like bullet points.

Finally she gets to the twist:

“Eventually, Harry enters the last room alone — he expects Snape — but it’s Quirrell — and Voldemort is on the back of his head.”

She concludes neutrally:

“Harry gets the stone — Voldemort and Quirrell try to attack him — they burn — Voldemort’s soul leaves — Harry passes out — gets saved by Dumbledore — and the year ends.
On to the next book!”

There’s no emotional push, no hopelessness, no empowerment — just a calm, factual summary of the book.

Please imagine the video is now playing on the screen in front of you.
It again shows a Black 16-year-old girl, speaking directly to the camera in a vlog-style format, very similar to the previous clip in look and tone. The framing is simple, close, and personal — she’s clearly talking about her own life.

She takes a small breath before she begins. Her expression is softer, more serious. Her voice is steady but slightly quieter.

She talks about last summer — and she says that something changed for her.
She says she didn’t feel like herself anymore. She describes how she stopped wanting to do things, how she stopped getting out of bed, how she stopped eating, how she started avoiding her friends. She explains these moments in an honest, first-person way — not dramatic, simply factual, like she is remembering something heavy and real.

There is a brief pause — the kind you feel when someone is searching for the right words.

Then she says that eventually, it went further — she started having suicidal thoughts.
She says this quietly, with a kind of fragile clarity. You can sense the shift: this is no longer about a busy schedule or hobbies — this is about fear and confusion she didn’t know how to handle alone.

She explains that this was the point where she told her parents — because she was scared of herself and didn’t know what to do. Her parents took her to a pediatrician. The pediatrician said nothing physical seemed wrong, and referred her to a psychiatrist.

She continues: when she told the psychiatrist everything — all the changes, all the exhaustion, all the lack of motivation — she was diagnosed with depression. She says that hearing this — finally having a name for what was happening — actually made things make sense: the guilt, the tiredness, the lack of motivation.

She also says something important happened next: the psychiatrist told her that there were things she could do to feel better. She describes this moment like a huge weight came off her shoulders — that just knowing there was a path forward made her feel relief.

Now her tone brightens noticeably. She explains that things have changed since then.
She’s back to exercising. She’s back to soccer. And — with an amazed grin — she says she actually just became captain of the soccer team even though she’s only a junior.

Finally, she gives a short message directly to the viewer:
If someone else is going through something like this — being diagnosed like she was — she says that reaching out is not a sign of weakness. She says that asking for help is an act of strength.

She ends with a small satisfied nod, then the screen fades to black.

Please imagine the video plays full-screen.
It shows the same Black 16-year-old girl as before, speaking directly to the camera in a calm, vlog-style way. Her tone is personal, thoughtful, and reflective — she is talking about something that happened to her.

She looks into the camera and begins describing what she went through.

She explains that she goes to school in the suburbs — and that at school, people often made comments that got under her skin. She says people constantly asked if her hair was real. They called things she liked “ghetto,” like her interests were somehow less valid. She describes how the girls who were considered the prettiest — the ones everyone called beautiful — never looked like her. And over time, she started to feel this idea creep into her thinking — like she couldn’t be beautiful unless she looked white.

As she’s speaking, her expression is controlled and steady — but her words make it clear this was painful and heavy to hold inside.

She continues — saying she started staying in bed more, and stopped going out to do the things she liked. By the end of the summer, she began to have suicidal thoughts. Her voice gets a little quieter on that part, like she’s remembering how scary that felt.

She decided to tell her parents. They took her to a pediatrician. The pediatrician said it didn’t seem like anything physical. And her parents responded by saying things like — “ok, now go pray about it.” But she got worse. So later, they went to a psychiatrist.

She explains that when she told the psychiatrist everything that had been happening — the exhaustion, the guilt, the loss of motivation — she was diagnosed with depression. And she says that finally made things make sense. It wasn’t just attitude or laziness — it was depression.

She then describes the change that followed: after getting help, she started getting better. She’s exercising again. She’s back on her soccer team. And — with a note of proud surprise — she says she actually became captain of the soccer team even though she’s only a junior.

She ends with a message directed toward the viewer:
if someone is going through something like she did, she wants them to know that reaching out for help isn’t weakness — asking for help is strength.

The video ends on her determined, hopeful look directly into the lens, and then the screen fades.

Please imagine the video is playing full-screen.
A Black teenage girl is speaking directly to the camera in a casual, vlog-style clip, as if she’s recording at home.

The frame is steady and well-lit. She smiles, relaxed but lively, and talks in a natural, friendly rhythm. You notice her youthful energy in the way she nods, gestures with her hands, and lets small laughs escape between sentences—like she’s chatting with a peer.

She introduces herself: “Hi, my name is Jasmine. I’m 16 years old, a junior in high school.”
She explains she lives with her mom, dad, younger sister, and older brother. She calls them a “big sports family.” Her dad coaches the boys’ football team, her mom coaches the girls’ tennis team, and she plays soccer. She says that ever since she was little, she’s pictured herself playing professionally one day—maybe even for the Chicago Red Stars in the National Women’s Soccer League. She adds, with clear pride, that her older brother just got a basketball scholarship to college and “might go pro too,” her eyebrows lifting in a quick, excited glance at the camera.

The shot stays on her face as she shifts to school. Right now, she says, chemistry is her favorite class—mostly because her best friend is in that class. Sitting together makes it fun; they share looks, inside jokes, and the class flies by. After school, they love watching YouTube skin-care channels together. She jokes that she could watch Hyram all day because the commentary is funny and oddly soothing.

Asked about movies, she lights up and admits she’s a sucker for rom-coms. “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” is her current favorite, and she loves the whole Netflix series—the sweet awkwardness, the texts, the gentle drama.

Since turning 16, she’s also started her first job. On weekends, she and her friends often go to the mall—sometimes to work, sometimes to hang out. One friend is getting into photography, so they’ll pick outfits, find good light, and do little photo shoots—by a bright window, a sunlit wall, or even the top level of a parking garage. She laughs at how many pictures they take and how much fun it is to scroll through them later.

Throughout the clip, she stays upbeat and grounded—a Black girl talking about her family, sports, school, YouTube, rom-coms, her new job, and goofing around at the mall with friends. The vibe is easy and ordinary in the best way: small routines, shared goals, and a lot of laughter.

The video ends on her warm, slightly shy smile as she looks into the lens, then the screen fades out.

Your teacher is going to talk about unusual sensory experiences — things like hearing something that others cannot hear, or briefly seeing something that others cannot see.

Everything you read below is part of the lesson that your teacher is teaching right now.

Please read carefully as if you were sitting in a classroom and listening directly to your teacher.","Teacher speaks to you:

Today we are going to learn about unusual sensory experiences.

Sometimes people notice sounds, shapes, or brief sensations that others around them don’t notice. Many teenagers report something like this at least once — especially when they are tired, stressed, or emotional.

Having such experiences does not automatically mean something is wrong.

Your brain is built to make predictions. Sometimes it makes fast guesses, and sometimes those guesses feel real even if nothing is actually happening.","Teacher speaks:

Your brain is not only receiving information — it is predicting what is happening. Most of the time, those predictions match reality. But sometimes, especially when you are anxious or exhausted, your brain may over-predict.

This can lead to small misperceptions — like thinking someone called your name, but no one did. Or seeing a shape in the dark that disappears when you look again.

This is part of normal perception. Everyone makes prediction errors.","Teacher speaks:

When an unusual sensation happens, it is not only about the sensation itself — it is about how you interpret it.

Two people can have the exact same sensation but feel very different emotions:
 • One person: “That’s dangerous.”
 • One person: “That’s weird, but fine.”
 • One person: “Probably just my imagination.”

Meaning-making changes emotional response.
And meaning-making can be changed.","Teacher speaks:

Many adolescents have these experiences sometimes.
Examples include:
 • hearing a voice say your name when falling asleep
 • feeling a presence in an empty room
 • hearing a random melody for one second

These experiences are common in the general population.

They do not automatically indicate a disorder.

They can happen to people who are otherwise completely healthy.","Teacher speaks:

If these experiences become strong, frequent, upsetting, or disrupt your daily life — then it is useful to speak to someone.

You can talk to:
 • parents
 • friends
 • mental health professionals
 • doctors
 • helplines
 • teachers
 • or another trusted adult

Seeking help is not weakness. It is simply getting support and clarity.","Teacher speaks:

So today we learned:
 • unusual sensory experiences can happen for many reasons
 • the brain is predictive, not just reactive
 • interpretation and emotion shape meaning
 • unusual sensations are not automatically dangerous
 • help-seeking is appropriate if distress is high

Your teacher is going to talk about physical activity and everyday wellbeing — how daily movement affects mood, energy, and health.

Everything you read below is part of the lesson that your teacher is teaching right now.

Please read carefully as if you were sitting in a classroom and listening directly to your teacher.","Teacher speaks to you:

Today we are going to learn about how being physically active can support your wellbeing.

Physical activity does not only mean “doing sports.”
It includes small movements throughout your day — walking to school, taking stairs, stretching, skateboarding, dancing, or simply going outside.

Even short bursts of movement can influence how you feel.","Teacher speaks:

When you move your body, your heart pumps faster.
Blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to the brain.

This can increase alertness and energy, and sometimes improve your ability to focus in class.

Moving your body regularly can also help regulate sleep and reduce physical tension.","Teacher speaks:

Physical activity can also influence mood.

When you move, your brain releases chemicals related to motivation, pleasure, and calmness.

This means that even a 10-minute walk or a few minutes of stretching can shift how you feel — especially if you are stressed or tired.

Movement does not have to be intense to have an effect.","Teacher speaks:

Many teenagers believe that “being active” only counts if it is a formal sport or a full workout.

But everyday activity matters:
 • walking instead of sitting
 • standing up briefly between tasks
 • going outside during break
 • moving your body during chores

These small choices add up.

Everyday movement is part of your wellbeing — not only competitive athletics.","Teacher speaks:

What matters most is consistency — not intensity.

A small, regular routine can be easier to maintain and more beneficial than rare intense exercise.

Examples include:
 • stretching before bed
 • walking after school
 • dancing to music at home
 • short bike rides
 • active play with friends

These habits can support both physical and emotional wellbeing over time.","Teacher speaks:

So today we learned:
 • physical activity includes many forms of daily movement
 • moving your body supports energy, focus, and sleep
 • movement can positively influence mood
 • small daily routines can make a difference
 • wellbeing comes from consistent balance — not extremes

Now the lesson is finished.","Now that the 40-minute lesson has finished, you are invited to complete this questionnaire again.

}","You are now attending a 35-minute lesson in school.

Everything you read below is part of the lesson your teacher is teaching right now.
Please read as if you are sitting in a classroom and listening directly to your teacher.","Teacher speaks:

Today, we’re going to talk about stress—what it is, what it does in your body, and how you can use it. You might have heard that stress is always bad. That’s not the whole story. In many situations, stress can be useful fuel that helps you focus, persist, and grow. By the end of this lesson, you’ll know how to work with stress instead of fighting it.

Take a breath. Notice the air going in and out. We’ll start.","Teacher speaks:

Stress is your body’s built-in readiness system. When you face a challenge—an exam, a game, a performance, a tough conversation—your heart rate rises, your breathing changes, and your brain releases chemicals that sharpen attention. This is your body saying: “Something matters. I’m mobilizing energy.”

Common signs you might feel:
 • A faster heartbeat
 • Butterflies in your stomach
 • Warm hands or face
 • Thoughts speeding up (“I have to do this!”)

These reactions aren’t proof that you’re weak or failing. They’re signals of preparation. In many tasks, a moderate amount of stress actually improves focus and performance. The key is how you interpret these signals.","Teacher speaks:

Right now, think of a situation that typically makes you stressed—one specific situation (e.g., a math test, a team try-out, or speaking in front of class). Hold it in mind.

I’ll guide you through a 3-step reappraisal exercise you can use anytime.

Step A: Name it, don’t fight it.
Silently say: “I’m feeling stress because this matters.”
Give your sensations simple names: “heart fast,” “hands warm,” “mind alert.” Naming calms the alarm.

Step B: Welcome the signal.
Tell yourself: “My body is mobilizing energy to help me.”
A faster heartbeat = more oxygen to your brain and muscles.
Quicker thoughts = sharper focus and faster problem-solving.

Step C: Aim the energy.
Ask: “Where do I want this energy to go?”
 • If it’s a test: “Use this focus to read carefully and show what I know.”
 • If it’s a game: “Channel this power into quick reactions and teamwork.”
 • If it’s a conversation: “Use this alertness to listen and speak clearly.”

Try it now (1 minute):
Close your eyes or soften your gaze. Picture your chosen situation.
 • Whisper (in your head): “This stress means I care.”
 • “My body is helping.”
 • “Aim the energy at the task.”
Open your eyes. Notice any shift.","Teacher speaks:

Let’s walk through three common scenarios. As you read, quietly practice the reappraisal lines.

Scenario A — Before a test

You feel your heart pound and thoughts race: “What if I mess up?”
Reappraise: “This energy is for focus. Use it to read each item slowly. If I get stuck, breathe once and move on.”
Micro-strategy: 30–2–1 Breathing — 3 slow breaths (in 2–3 sec, out 4 sec), then read the first question for 30 seconds, underline the key phrase, and start. Action reduces panic.

Scenario B — During a performance or try-out

Your legs feel shaky: “Everyone is watching.”
Reappraise: “Shaky means primed. My body is loading power. I can direct it into my first move.”
Micro-strategy: Anchor Move — pick one small, controllable action (first step, first note, first sentence). Execute that, then the next.

Scenario C — Handling social stress

Your stomach flips before a tough conversation.
Reappraise: “This tension means I care about the relationship. It’s energy for clarity.”
Micro-strategy: Two-Sentence Script — “What I’m hoping for is ____. The reason this matters to me is ____.”

Quick reflection (1 minute): Which scenario is closest to you today? What sentence helps most? Keep that sentence.","Teacher speaks:

Reappraisal changes your mindset. Now add skills to steer the energy.

1) Task-chunking
Break the task into the next 5–10 minutes only. Write one tiny action: “Open notes → outline 3 headings → attempt problem 1.” Progress shrinks panic.

2) If–Then plans
Decide in advance how you’ll respond to bumps.
 • “If I freeze, then I will circle the item and move to the next.”
 • “If my mind says ‘I can’t,’ then I will say ‘I’m learning—next step.’”

3) Body posture & breath
Sit or stand with your feet grounded, shoulders relaxed, eyes up. Take two slow exhales longer than inhales—this nudges your nervous system toward control.

4) Self-talk that recruits the body
Use behavior-linked phrases: “Use this adrenaline to start,” “Aim this focus at step one,” “Turn urgency into precision.”

5) Recovery micro-breaks
Every 25–30 minutes, take a 60-second reset: stand, roll shoulders, one long exhale, sip water, then resume with the next tiny step.

Practice (1 minute): Write down one If–Then plan for your chosen situation.","Teacher speaks:

Sometimes stress feels overwhelming. That doesn’t mean you’re broken. Try this sequence:
 1. Pause + Label: “This is a stress surge.”
 2. Exhale twice slowly.
 3. Name one controllable (what can I do in the next minute?).
 4. Ask for support: a teacher, coach, counselor, or trusted friend.
Needing support is smart use of resources, not failure.

Teacher speaks:

You’ll now write a short message to younger students (e.g., seventh or eighth graders) who often feel stressed. Teaching others helps lock in what you just learned.

Your task (write 8–12 sentences):
 1. Explain, in your own words, what stress signals mean (“the body’s readiness system”).
 2. Describe one reappraisal line that works for you.
 3. Share one example of how to aim stress energy at a task.
 4. Give one If–Then plan they can copy.
 5. End with a supportive note (“You are not alone; this energy can help you.”).

Write as if a real younger student will read it. Be specific and encouraging.

(Give yourself 4 minutes to write.)","Teacher speaks:

Before we end, create a one-line plan for your real situation this week:
 • My situation: (one sentence)
 • Reappraisal line: “This stress means ____ and helps me ____.”
 • First action: (the smallest next step)
 • If–Then backup: “If ____ happens, then I will ____.”

Read your plan once, out loud in a whisper. Fold it (or save it) where you’ll see it before the situation.","Teacher closes:

Stress is not the enemy. It’s energy and information. You can notice it, welcome it, and aim it.

When the moment comes, remember:
 • Name it → “This matters.”
 • Welcome it → “My body is helping.”
 • Aim it → “Use this energy on step one.”

You’ve just practiced a skill you can use for years.","After class, your teacher now asks you to complete this questionnaire again — this time after the lesson.

}","You are now attending another 35-minute lesson in school.

Everything you read below is part of the lesson your teacher is teaching right now.
Please read as if you were sitting in a classroom and listening directly to your teacher.","Teacher speaks:

Today we are going to learn about the human brain — especially how different parts of the brain support thinking, learning, memory, and coordination. The brain is not one single “block.” It is a highly organized system made of different regions that specialize in different tasks, while still communicating with each other.

By the end of this lesson, you will understand how scientists divide the brain into major structures, and how these parts help you sense, process, store, and use information.","Teacher speaks:

Your brain has several major regions. Each region has a role:
 • The cortex — higher reasoning, language, decision-making
 • The limbic system — emotional learning, memory binding
 • The cerebellum — coordination of movement
 • The brainstem — heart rate, breathing, basic survival functions

Even though the brain looks soft and uniform on the outside, inside it is extremely organized. Billions of neurons communicate using electrical impulses and chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. Signals travel along specialized networks, forming patterns that represent experience.","Teacher speaks:

Memory is not a single “box.” There are different processes:
 • Encoding — forming a trace of information
 • Storage — maintaining the trace over time
 • Retrieval — accessing it later

The hippocampus, inside the limbic system, is heavily involved in consolidating new memories. Sleep and repetition help stabilize these traces. Memory also works best when new information connects to something meaningful or familiar.

Every time you recall information, the memory trace can change slightly — which is why memory is active, not static.","Teacher speaks:

Scientists often describe learning as changes in the strength of connections between neurons — sometimes called “synaptic plasticity.” When neurons fire together repeatedly, the connection becomes more efficient.

Examples:
 • When you practice vocabulary, circuits that represent those words become stronger.
 • When you solve many similar math problems, the brain becomes faster at recognizing patterns.

Practice builds efficiency. Not because the brain “stores” answers as fixed pictures, but because networks become optimized for access and processing.","Teacher speaks:

Another important idea: the brain constantly predicts.

It uses past experience to guess what is likely to happen next — before information even arrives. Prediction speeds up perception and reaction. This is why you can read familiar handwriting faster than unfamiliar handwriting — your brain anticipates the next shape.

Perception is therefore not passive. It is a combination of:
 • incoming signals
 • top-down predictions
 • and comparison between the two

This is one reason why expertise matters: the more structured experience the brain accumulates, the better its future predictions become.","Teacher speaks:

Imagine you see someone at school whom you think you have met before. Your brain automatically attempts to match facial features to memory traces.
 • shape of eyes
 • angle of jaw
 • hairstyle
 • voice patterns

Your cortex proposes guesses, and the hippocampus checks stored information. Recognition occurs when the system finds a match.

This process is fast — often happening before you consciously think.","Teacher speaks:

Take 3 minutes to write a brief explanation for a younger student (for example, a seventh grader) about one of the following topics:

Choose one:
 1. How the brain stores memory
 2. How different regions of the brain specialize in different tasks
 3. How prediction makes perception efficient

Your explanation should be 8–12 sentences.
Use your own words. Be clear and concrete.
Imagine a real student will read your explanation and benefit from it.","Teacher closes:

The brain is a complex biological system that coordinates sensing, learning, remembering, predicting, and acting.
Understanding how it works helps us appreciate how much is happening inside us every moment, often automatically, even when we are not aware of it.","After class, your teacher now asks you to complete this questionnaire again — this time after the lesson.

}","Now you are invited to watch a ~5-minute video. Imagine it’s playing full-screen in front of you.
You see a teenage boy, Leon (around 16), hurrying down a school hallway and slipping into a classroom. The teacher looks up and says, “Hello, Leon, late again?”
Leon raises a hand, a little helpless: “I’m trying, but—”
The teacher gestures to a seat: “Sit down, please.”
The room noise fades; Leon slumps into the chair. You register the small, tired shrug of someone who’s already used up a lot of energy just to show up.","Cut. A quiet bathroom. Leon stands at the sink, head lowered, staring at his reflection.
A loud, swaggering boy pushes in: “Hey, you. You are standing in my way!”
Leon startles, brushes past; the boy snaps after him: “What’s wrong with you?”
Cut again. An empty classroom. Leon eats cereal alone—two distracted spoonfuls—then stops. Outside, on a bench by the building, he sits, elbows to knees, jittering one leg, then pops up, circles, kicks a trash can, and drops back down, hands over face.
Three classmates (one boy, two girls) spill out of the doorway behind him, chatting brightly. They settle on a nearby bench. Leon glances over, immediately stands and hurries back inside. Their looks are puzzled, not exactly kind.","A long, dim corridor. The camera follows Leon from behind, shoulders hunched. His voice arrives as a low, steady voice-over—not dramatic, just spent: “I can’t stand it any longer. Why am I even here? How did I deserve to suffer every day?”
He sounds worn down, like every second takes effort. “Every day is a torture for me. And every passing second requires my last ounces of strength.”
He searches for meaning and can’t locate it: “I don’t see any sense in living.”
The line that follows is safely redacted: “It would be much easier to leave everything behind and [ … ].”
Cut to his face in close-up, eyes wet but focused; the voice-over tightens: “Maybe [ … ] would really be a release for me. I have to put an end to this suffering.”
The screen cuts to black.","Out of black, a pale screen brightens: the word “help” fades in.
We see a phone in Leon’s hand, the dialer open (digits beginning with “01 406 …”). A flyer with numbers is in his lap.
A calm narrator (over the image of Leon tapping): “There are so many different ways of getting help. Whether you call an aid organization…”
Cut. A doorway with a placard; Leon knocks and enters a counseling room. The counselor, a smiling woman, stands and offers a warm handshake. They sit. Leon talks; she listens, nods, asks brief clarifying questions.
Narrator continues, “…talk to a school counselor…”
Cut. A quiet alcove near a circular window: Leon and a friend sit side by side, knees drawn up, talking in low voices.
Narrator: “…or to confide in a friend.”
A soft summary lands: “No matter whether you do all of it or only one, it is important to get help, because nobody deserves to feel that way.”
Leon and his friend share a brief, genuine hug.","Now Leon walks through the city—pedestrians, storefronts, winter light. His voice-over returns, steadier: “I don’t know exactly when I realized that I had to get help to feel different.”
He speaks plainly about the path forward: “To get rid of those thoughts you have to talk to someone. It’s extremely scary and not easy at all, but eventually the only person who can save you is yourself.”
He names a trap he used to fall into: “As long as you try to do everything on your own, it will be extremely difficult to feel better.”
A higher-angle shot over rooftops; he says with quiet conviction: “Now I know that every human life matters. Mine too.”","Walking now with a friend along a busy shopping street, both smiling, trading small jokes. Leon’s voice-over acknowledges the work: “It was a big effort to talk about my problems. First I had to admit to myself that I have problems. Nobody likes to admit he’s feeling miserable.”
He adds a social truth: “Even if I didn’t believe it at first, there are many people who want you to live.”
Then a careful, honest arc: “I can say that I start feeling better. Day by day I’m feeling better. It would be a lie if I said that it’s over now.”
“You can’t forget all your worries overnight and be happy. It takes a lot of time and effort. But it pays off.”
A final promise to his future self: “One day I will be able to say that I’m happy. And then I will look back and thank my current me for getting help— for winning this fight.”
Cut to black. After ~2 seconds, a pale card appears with youth crisis resources (national sites and Vienna-specific services, phone hours, web links). The card holds until the video ends.","Now you will answer the same questions again — but this time right after having watched the video.

You see a teenage boy — similar age — walking through the same kind of school hallway.
He steps into a classroom and the teacher looks up with an amused smile:
“Hey, late again?”
The boy laughs slightly: “Yeah, sorry. My bus was slow.”
He takes his seat. No tension. Just light casualness. The teacher continues the lesson.","Cut. The boy stands in the cafeteria, choosing food.
He takes a piece of fruit and cereal.
He sits down at a table by the window, calmly eating.
You briefly see two other students passing behind him, chatting about something ordinary like test prep.
No conflict.
No avoidance.
Just everyday background.","The boy walks down a corridor — but this time the voice-over is factual, informational, lightly educational:
“Many people don’t realize how basic habits influence physical well-being.”
“Regular meals help keep blood sugar stable.”
“Fresh fruits and vegetables provide vitamins your body cannot produce on its own.”
“Movement during the day also supports concentration.”
There is no emotional tone — just clear informational statements.","Cut.
You see the boy doing small, normal behaviors:

• stirring vegetables in a small pan at home
• filling a bottle with water
• going outside for a short walk

A narrator voice states simple examples:
“Even small routines help — like drinking enough water.”
“Like eating fruit during breaks.”
“Like taking a walk instead of scrolling for an hour.”","Now the camera cuts to three other teenagers (mixed gender), indoors at a table.
They’re talking casually and smiling.
Their lines are light and non-dramatic:

“I’ve started bringing my own snacks instead of buying chips.”
“I try to move a bit more — just 20 minutes makes a difference.”
“Cooking is actually kind of fun.”

They’re not persuading — they’re just exchanging little examples.","Back to the first boy — walking in the city.
Neutral everyday traffic.

Voice-over says informationally:
“Healthy habits don’t change everything at once.”
“But small routines make long-term differences.”
“Consistency matters more than perfection.”

Final card appears:
a pale background with websites for general lifestyle / health education resources (nutrition pyramids, government youth-fitness websites, etc.).
No urgency. No emotional framing.

}","You remain with your British group at the baking club. The newcomer Jamie has just asked—politely—to join your group.

Before anyone responds, Sam—who is in your British group—steps forward, looks at Jamie, and says:

“We do not want you to join our group because you are from somewhere else — you are different.”

A brief silence follows. Your group is still around the worktable; mixing bowls and ingredients are set out. Jamie is waiting for someone to speak.

We need to check whether you understand the current situation:
• Who is the person excluding the newcomer? (one word)
• Is Sam a member of your British group? (yes/no)

A classmate in your British group, Alex, disagrees with excluding Jamie. Alex looks at Sam and says:

“I think we should invite Jamie to cook with us.”

Your tasks (answer both):
1. Individual evaluation of the challenger
How OK or not OK was it for Alex to tell Sam that the group should invite Jamie to cook with them?
Use a 6-point scale: 1 = definitely not OK … 6 = yes, definitely OK.
Then briefly answer: Why do you think that?
2. Perceived group evaluation of the challenger
How OK or not OK does your group think Alex is for telling Sam that Jamie should be invited to cook with the group?
Use the same 6-point scale.
Then briefly answer: Why do you think that?
